Below is a simple C program that calculates the sum of the first N square numbers using a loop:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N, sum = 0;
    printf("Enter a number N: ");
    scanf("%d", &N);

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        sum += i*i;
    }

    printf("The sum of the first %d square numbers is: %d\n", N, sum);
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a loop to accumulate the sum of squares from 1 to N.
